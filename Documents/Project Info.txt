The Twin Tube

	Introduction
	
	The Team:
	Hi everyone, this is team 6. A team of six individuals from the data science and data engineering cohort. We have been assigned
	the Tube Twin project and this is our presentation on how we plan to execute it and what we've been able to achieve so far. 
		
	The project: 
	Tube Twin (Passenger count forecasting/general Tube analysis) 
	This is a digital twin of the london tube that can be used for passenger count and traffic analyses/forecasting. 
	
	The Client:
	The London Underground 	
	The London Underground (aka “The Tube”) is a network of train stations which connects the city of London. 
=======================================

	Solution 
	
	Our proposed solution include achieving the following: 
	
	Create a digital representation of the Tube: 
	A graph representation of the network (either via a simple Python library like networkx or if there is more substantial data
	engineering expertise in the team, and if it makes technical sense, via a graph database). 
		
	Develop	a passenger count forecasting model: 
	A passenger count forecast at each station (entry and exit), in 15 minutes increments, based on time of day, and counts at 
	other stations. 
	
	Analyse historic passenger count data: 
	A study of the effect of significant events (holidays, football games, etc) on traffic as well as the relationships between counts at 
	different stations.
